# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**Note: This starter template is designed for use with Bun.sh instead of Node.js.**

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. Install Bun.sh by following the installation instructions on the [Bun.sh GitHub repository](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `bun install` in the project directory.
4. Start the development server by running `bun run dev`.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the React app in action.

With Bun.sh, you can enjoy faster startup times and reduced memory usage compared to Node.js. Additionally, Bun.sh provides a test runner, script runner, and Node.js-compatible package manager, making it a powerful tool for JavaScript and TypeScript apps.

For more information on using Bun.sh, refer to the [Bun.sh documentation](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun).
